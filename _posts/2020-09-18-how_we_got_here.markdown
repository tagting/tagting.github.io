When I think of bootcamp I think back to the first year of art school. No one tells you how brutal it is compared to the regular first year expereince for new incoming freshmens. Studio art classes were six-hours long with weekly critiques where you stood in the middle of the room to defend your work. At first students were kind and gave what a professor described as "*fluffy*" comments. After several lectures about the difference of being subjective and objective, we students went from saying, "*That's pretty, I like how you defined that line*" to "*the weight on that line adds gravity the overall mass of the object you rendered. But you lost the viewer's attention by putting it in the middle of the plane*". 

I'm pretty sure endless nights trying to churning a still-life drawing out while reading up about some artist who had a rauchy affair with a muse prepared me for this. Which shows that I have the patience for the practical and the obscure.

I have heard that some people go into Software Engineering for the money and that's fine. I came here for the money to be honest. But do I enjoy enjoy talking to my computer screen, starring at a piece of a code for hours and figuring out why things don't work; to all them I give you a joking, Yes.

I can say I'm lucky because I have been indirectly influenced by technology and programming from an early age. In middle school I used to spend my homework time building web pages that glittered and sparkled. In high school I learned some database queries for a business technology class and wondered when I would ever used this in a job.

My ah huh momement that I wanted to do this was when an IT co-worker built a script to make folders within folders with numerical labels from 1 to 100. I told myslef I wanted to do that and I was going to do that. So I went back to school and enrolled myself in a community college to major in IT. Took some classes on web programming, Python and project planning. Then the pandemic hit and plans were either haulted and changed. There's always a silver lining to things and I found from a friend that there was a scholarship open for women+ inidviduals who want to enter the tech industry.

With help from the Michigan Digital Skills Initiative Scholarship I was able to apply for Flatiron and start my journey as a software enigneeer.
